## Collection Metadata

The table below provides sorting and basic search of the collection contents. 
Use the "CSV" or "Excel" button below to download the filtered metadata you see on the page in your preferred format. 
Alternatively, click the "Download" button at the top right to view the full collection metadata in various export formats.  

## Controlled Vocabulary  
The controlled vocabulary that was used for this project stems from terms that the fandom uses to classify Squishmallows. For a full list of offcial Squishmallow names check out the [Squishmallow Wiki](https://squishmallowsquad.fandom.com/wiki/Master_List). SquadApp, a Squishmallow collectoring guide, was also used to gather terms and check that the information gathered about each Squishmallow was correct.

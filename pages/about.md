## What are Squishmallows

Squishmallows are the latest pop culture phenomenon which has been dubbed as Gen Zâ€™s Beanie Baby raze.  While the main target audience of the toys is children, adults have been huge fans of Squishmallows. An article from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/24/squishmallows-toy/) interviewed a collector who has upwards of 400 Squishmallows in their collection. A lot of the appeal of Squishmallows comes from their cute appearance, soft fabric texture, and cloud-like stuffing. Another reason that collectors buy them is because of their personalities. Each Squishmallow also comes with their own biography that highlights their interests.  

## About the Collection  

This collection of Squishmallows is from Julia. She currently has 124 Squishmallows in her collection that range in a variety of sizes and types. This digital library only highlights 24 of the items in her collection. The items that were selected were based on her favorites as well as for their uniqueness within her collection.
